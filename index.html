          <em>Background</em><br>
          <p>I am currently a university student majoring in computer science in strathmore university. I developed an interest in computers at a very young age and always hung around my parentsas they worked on their desktop. I went ahead and taught myself how to type since it seemed cool in movies, but after learning that I wondered "what next?". So after clearing school I took a class on computer packages but still the knowledge gained seemed so shallow. That is when I decided to go deeper into computers and how they function. And since the world is getting digital I thought it wise to venture into how websites are made and how they work.  I tried teaching mysel a few times but it dawned on me that I had commitment issues, I could not keep up with the training and always gave up early. I just could not accept that as fate so I asked around and lucky enough a friend pointed out a coding community known as Moringa. That officially marked the start of my journey as a coder.</p>
